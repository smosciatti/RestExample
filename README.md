# RestExample
This is my first experiece with restAssured project. I will play more with jsonplaceholder site
My maily goal is to familiarize more with the concept. 
After some tests and unresolved error, i decide to create project in eclipse, instead of intellij.

This initial release will provide get and post call 

Project consist of main class, that perform the call
postCall deprecated : provide post methods 
getCall  provide a method that baed on the requet type,  perform the HTTP call and return back the response

Open Topics
